## Lizao Wu's First CS193 Homework

This is Wu00018's page for Homework0 in the course of CS 193 he choosed. This is just a testing page and has nothing meaningful. Then, I have to syay something I like about CS193 to complete my homework:

-The grading system is great and relative easier to get an A.
-I don't need to pay for any textbook, as there is no textbook required.
-The magicword question in the attendence quiz is interesting.
